# stiko
A systray icon for syncthing.

Tested on debian testing (as of Oct 1, 2015).

Allows to designate some devices as servers. Then it reports "Up to Date" if local files are up to date and at least one server is up to date.

If no servers are present, it gets gray. 

If servers are present and local files are not up to date, it wiggles. 

Great for dropbox fanboys which need just one look to know if they can turn off computer/start working.
